Github is an open source version control. The main point of Github is it lets multiple people work on a project and it lets others veiw your work. There is a green botton thats says create repository. When you press on it it would create a repository which will store all the work for your project. You have a choie to create a readme file which will give you the opportunity to breifly explain what the project is. The repository has one main branch which will protray the final product. When trying out new things to see if it works you can create another branch. To do this go to the new repository, click the file that says branch: name, type in a branch name, and click enter. In this branch you can make and save changes. These saved changes are called commit. to create a commit: Click the README.md file,Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit, write about yourself in the editor, then write a commit messages that exlains the changes,and then click the commit changes button. You can pull requests in Github which requests that someone review your commit/changes. To do this click the pull request tab,then New pull request,then select the branch that you made changes with and the main branch,then press create pull request and give it a title with a breif explanation of the changes. The final step is to merge your pull reuests to the main so your changes will appear on the main branch.To do this Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into main.Then click confirm merge. There will also be an option to delete the branch since all your changes were moved to the main.
